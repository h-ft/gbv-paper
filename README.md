Repository containing code and paper for the module Graphics and Image Processing by Prof. Erik Rodner

Code: The code is located inside the folder 'jupyter'. The environment 'bvlecture' is sufficient to run this code, with an addition of imutils which needs to be installed separately using 'pip install imutils'. The pretrained network is located inside the same folder.

Results of the detection can be found inside jupyter/results/* with the asterisk being either easy, inter, or hard.

Paper: The paper is written using Latex. Both the .tex and .pdf files are to be found in the repository.
